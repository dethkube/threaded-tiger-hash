This program computes the Tiger Tree hash of a variable number of files using between 1 and 1024
threads to compute the hash of individual blocks in the hash tree for each file.

To compile:

$ make
-or-
$ make p2

To run:

$ ./p2 <numthreads> <file1> [<file2> ...]

which will write each calculated hash to a file named <hashedfile>.tth
